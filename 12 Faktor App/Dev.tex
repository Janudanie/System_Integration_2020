\section*{Dev/prod parity}
This is about the difference in the development environment and the production environment.

There are a few guidelines to follow:
\begin{itemize}
\item Keep the time between deploys to a minimal.
\item Code author and and deployer should be the same.
\item Keep the difference between dev and prod to a minimal.
\end{itemize}
