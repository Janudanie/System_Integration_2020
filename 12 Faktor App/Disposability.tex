\section*{Disposability}
This is about fast start up and graceful shutdowns.

There are a few rules:
\begin{itemize}
\item The app should aim for a fast startup time, so scaling will be fast if(when) needed.
\item The app should shutdown gracefully, meaning, stop taking new requests, and finish the ones it are working on.
\end{itemize}
