\section*{Backing services}
This describes the backing services or the resources the app needs. This can be a database or a public api the app needs to run.
There are a few ground rules this step has:

\begin{itemize}
\item The config of connection to a resource has to be in the config, not in the code base.
\item A resource has to be able swaped out if it fails, usely by changing the config to use another resource, without changing the code base.

\end{itemize}
