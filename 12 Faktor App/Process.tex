\section*{Processes}
Explains about the execution environment for the app.
There are a few rules to follow here:

\begin{itemize}
\item The process has to be stateless and share nothing.
\item Data persisted, has to be dealt with in that transaction, because you dont know, if the same server will respond next time.
\end{itemize}
