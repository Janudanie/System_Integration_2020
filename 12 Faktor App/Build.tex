\section*{Build, release,run}
This is about the 3 stages of the app.
The 3 stages are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Build, this is where the code base is compiled, and dependencies are added.
\item Release, this is where the build and config are combined.
\item Run, this is where the release is installed on a system, and can be executed.
\end{itemize}
