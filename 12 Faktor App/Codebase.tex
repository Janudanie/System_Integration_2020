\section*{Codebase}
The code base is the code of the app.
There are a few rules about what makes the code base:
\begin{itemize}
\item The code base refere to a single repository.
\item An app is based on a codebase, the app does not share this code base with any other app.
\item If code is to be used between different apps, it has to be taken out of the app, and handled as a libery, and imported through a package manager.
\item There can be different versions of the codebase running at the same time, ie in the developer environment the code base version would be hgiher, the that in the production environment.
\end{itemize}
