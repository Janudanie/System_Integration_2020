## REST and Soap implementation

## Rest

I have made a rest client that pulled fun facts about cats from a rest server.
The rest server pulls the fun facts from "https://cat-fact.herokuapp.com/facts/"

### Resources
There are two resources:
  
  /fact
This gives all the fun facts about cat in a long json string

  /fact/{id}
This gives one specifik facted based on the id of the fact in a json string.

## Soap

Not done at the moment.


## Installation guide

download the project. build it. Deploy to a tomcat service (version 10 +)
