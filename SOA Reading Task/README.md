## What is the difference: SOA vs SaaS?

To first answer this question, we need to know what are the two things.


### Service-oriented architecture (SOA)
SOA is about making a service, that provide a something for a component of a system.
For an example is a credit card service a product of SOA.


### Software as a service (SaaS)
Saas is a complete package of software. For an example office 360 is an SaaS. Usely based on a multitenancy architecture. 


### SOA vs SaaS
If i was understanding it correctly, SaaS is a complete system. 
SOA is the idea of creating software designed for a single service.

I might have read it wrong, but seems they are not really the same. 
Hard to compare it.

You can use SOA to create a service consumed by a SaaS software.
